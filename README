This is mdemo, an example package that uses GNU libtool with an
Automake-generated environment to build two simple modules and 
a program.

It demonstrates how to build both dynamic and static libraries
that can be dlopened. mdemo uses libtool's portable dlopen
wrapper called "libltdl". 
All exported symbols are prefixed with "libname_LTX_" to avoid
symbols conflicts, especially when linking statically.
libltdl will automatically cut the prefix off to get the real name.
